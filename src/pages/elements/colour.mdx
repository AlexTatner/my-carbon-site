<PageDescription>

The colours in this standard have been created for products and 
services displayed on digital screens. 

We distinguish between colours that are being used across all our products and colours that are specific to different experiences – for instance colours that are specific to planning or travelling, paying or using an account, discovering new services or features and getting help and support.
